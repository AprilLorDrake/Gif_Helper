# Copilot instructions for GIF Helper

- Goal: tiny Windows helper to open a GIFs folder, ensure it exists, copy its path to clipboard, and open Explorer so users can preview GIFs (Alt+P) before uploading (e.g., LinkedIn).
- Layout:
  - `tools/open_gif_folder.ps1` — core logic: prompt for base folder (default `$env:USERPROFILE\Pictures`), create/ensure `GIFs`, copy path via `Set-Clipboard`, open Explorer.
  - `tools/open_gif_folder.bat` — double-click wrapper: invokes the PS1 with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` and forwards any args (`%*`).
- Expected flow (PS1): prompt → resolve base folder (accept empty as default) → if user points at a folder named `gif`/`gifs`, reuse it; else if the provided folder already has a `gif`/`gifs` child, reuse that; else append `GIFs` → `Test-Path`/`New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force` → try `Set-Clipboard` (swallow errors) → `Start-Process explorer.exe <gifFolder>` → writes two `Write-Host` lines for status/hint.
- Usage examples:
  - Double-click `tools/open_gif_folder.bat` and press Enter at the prompt to use `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures`.
  - `open_gif_folder.bat "D:\Media"` pre-fills prompt with `D:\Media`, then uses/creates `D:\Media\GIFs`.
- Platform assumptions: Windows-only; PowerShell available. Bat wrapper intentionally uses `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for click-to-run convenience.
- UX notes: Preview animated GIFs via Explorer Preview pane (Alt+P). Browser file pickers stay static; clipboard already has folder path for quick paste into address bar.
- Dependencies: built-in PowerShell cmdlets only; keep zero external deps. If you add modules, document install steps and avoid breaking click-to-run.
- Editing patterns:
  - Preserve prompt-and-default flow and the `GIFs` subfolder convention.
  - Keep clipboard copy best-effort (try/catch empty) to avoid blocking on clipboard issues.
  - Avoid noisy output—current contract is two concise `Write-Host` lines.
- Manual validation checklist:
  - Run PS1 directly and via BAT; accept default and custom base paths.
  - Confirm `GIFs` creation when missing and no error if it already exists.
  - Verify Explorer opens at `GIFs` and clipboard contains the folder path.
- Reference: README highlights quick start, Explorer Preview pane tip, WebP/AVIF codec note, and GitHub Desktop publish steps—keep those in sync if behavior changes.
